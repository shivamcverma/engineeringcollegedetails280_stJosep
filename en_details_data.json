Extra books can be provided on demand. Basic hostel facilities include bed, mattress, pillow, and bathroom items. Every room has average Wi-Fi with 16 Mbps speed. Mess food quality is low and not very nutritious. Medical, sports, gym, and games are well maintained and worth it.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers mostly are well qualified and knowledgeable, with good teaching methods, leaving some with a very rigid and boring way of teaching, which, we all can agree, happens in every college. The curriculum needs to be revised with modern subjects, and a big change is required in the first-year syllabus. Semester exams are application-based with good conceptual questions and average evaluation guidelines. There are two midterms of 50 marks summed up into 30, two quizzes of 5 marks each, 5 marks for attendance, 5 for assignment, and a 50-mark end-semester examination.",
              "Other": "Well, I got a 40% scholarship on fests due to my JEE rank, and this is a good option to go with for a CSE degree. The professors are okay, and the curriculum is good enough. You get a lot of time to work on your personal skills. Coding culture is too low, that can be worked upon, and clubs mostly begin normally but get lost in interior politics down the line. Fests are okay but can be made far better if the administration actually opens up and looks at things other than just academics. Crowd has increased definitely."

Only interns who had done their summer internship were given ppo. Even the internship process itself was shady. I had a CGPA of 9.7 when Microsoft came and the college only allowed the top 30 students to submit their resumes. I was able to submit my resume but after that, I do not know what happened and only five students were randomly selected. Even their resumes were not that good. Same with the biggest company, Commvault, from whom mysteriously the names of several students were struck off. The college passed it off as company shortlisting but everybody knows what it is. No doubt no one was hired by Commvault and it subsequently banned SMIT, as far as I got to know. The TNP is very shady, bringing totally worthless companies offering a mere package of even 2.75 LPA with ~ 2 years of bond. The placement states are poor; they look, this is a tier-3 college. No doubt bringing companies is something I understand but why hide things? I can go on writing so much more about this but the result will be the same. I hope somebody needs to read this. If placement is the sole criteria, please do not come here. Manipal Jaipur, Chandigarh University, Amity Noida, and LPU are some good options for those who have messed up Main. I am writing this anonymously because I am afraid that the college administration will find me out. But trust me when I say that all the above points I mentioned are true.",

If you enjoy late-night stuff, the hostel is good in that regard. The course I had taken was B.Teach in CSE. Very outdated, and the faculty is too disinterested to teach. Some of them are good; others are really bad. They might be knowledgeable, as I had mentioned but there is a difference between being knowledgeable and being a good teacher. 3 stars just for the hostel and physical infrastructure.",
              "Faculty": "The good faculty members have mostly left. I do not mean to dishonor any teacher but many of them are full of ego. especially the ones sitting at the top. They might be very knowledgeable, having published so many research papers but they do not know how to impart that knowledge. One thing I would like to mention is that teachers are approachable. They will try their best to make you understand. Many of them are friendly as well and will try their best to help you, even on a personal level. But everything gets turned down because of the placement, poor management, and some egoistic teachers sitting at the top as heads of respective departments. The Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics department teachers are by far the best and most knowledgeable of the lot. The syllabus is outdated, in my frank opinion but I think that is the case with every tier-3 college. You need to explore things on your own, outside of college studies, to grow.",
              "Other": "Whatever I will be mentioning here will be absolutely true. As I mentioned, I am writing this anonymously so that the college does not figure me out. Not that I care if they figure it out but I still would like to keep my identity hidden. If you enjoy changing around and do not care anything about your career, then SMIT is just that. Fests and events are less than what they used to be in pre-covid times but the crowd here is fun-loving. Drinks, parties, strong friendships, fights, and romance—expect every bit of this. College is pretty hilly in these aspects. But if you are looking for placement, it is not good. I do not want to use harsh words but I will say this much: the college management has itself messed up everything. Companies cracked by students off-campus are shown as on-campus placements. Amazon has never come to this college. So is WatchGuard and that 36.5 LPA package you see. The only big branded companies that have ever come are Microsoft, Commvault, and Providence. College is little lenient if you have problem with If you are not getting any good colleges, I will recommend a few, and please trust me with this again. I have been at your place and know exactly what I should have done. Go to Manipal Jaipur, Chandigarh University, Amity Nodia, LPU, TIET, and MAIT. Trust me, these are way better than this college. One more thing to those people from my college who are outraged by this writing: I have written only the truth. Things that I could not say back in college due to fear of you people withholding my degree. I was one of the best in college but I am really ashamed of this college."

All amenities are given in the hostel but not the Wi-Fi. Students are facing many problems due to this only. Study hour is maintained inside the campus, for which, from 6 to 9, no student is allowed to roam outside.",

It would be better if Wi-Fi were given to hostels because students have to move to either the library or the lawn to access it. Connectivity between students is good, and the seniors are helpful."

By the time they reach their fourth year, there will be around 700 students remaining. The highest salary package offered is 35 LPA. The average salary package offered is 4 LPA. Almost 70% of students got placements. The top recruiting company is Silicon. It is recognized for its consistency in placements among engineering institutes in Odisha. More than 70% of students get placed every year. Around 50% of students get placed with an average compensation of more than 5 LPA. The number of students with paid internships increases every year. The highest stipend offered is Rs. 60,000 per month in 2024. Top companies in product development, startups, and IT services from diverse sectors recruit Silicon students. Some of the notable recruiters from the past three years are Accenture, Adani Group, Aptus Data Labs, Capgemini, Cognizant, Cozentus, CoreEL Technologies, Deloitte, DeepSource, Genpact, IBM, Infosys, Innoware, Jindal Group, LTTS, MentorGraphics, Micron Technology, Mindtree, Mindfire Solutions, Pcon Utilities, Prodapt, PwC, SAP Labs, Scaledge, Surya Digital, Spikewell, TCS, Tata Power, ValueLabs, Vodafone Idea, and Work.",
              "Infrastructure": "The lab is average because all the equipment is a little old. Around 80% of the equipment is working. Classrooms are good. Around 60% of classrooms have air conditioners. About 40 classrooms do not have air conditioners. The campus is very small. Classrooms have projectors. Wi-Fi is not available everywhere, but it is available in limited areas.The library is available. Some labs and classrooms are average. The hostel is average because there is no Wi-Fi. They maintain it very well. The security system is very good. They are very helpful to us. The food quality is good. The canteen is also good. There is a doctor available in the evening. If students want medicine, they have to go out of the campus. Sports are very good. Students get leather courts. There are 2 basketball courts, two badminton courts, one volleyball court, and two indoor courts. There are badminton courts inside the hostel.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are knowledgeable. The teaching should cover both theory and practicals. It should be interesting. Different teaching methodologies like lectures, case studies, project work, etc., should be provided. Assessments at regular intervals are held to understand the progress. The curriculum should be in sync with the current industry requirements and the latest technological advancements. Outdated courses would not help students perform well in today's job scenarios. Students must acquire relevant skills that companies look for along with their academics. It may involve internships, live projects, industry-based learning, and exposure to existing tools and technologies. Faculty members are good. They help in any situation. They are always ready to help students on or off campus. We have B.Tech and master's courses. Exams are quite challenging, and the evaluation process is tough. Therefore, if anyone is willing to come, please read this carefully regarding the last year, 2023.",

              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure is not up to the mark. As it's a university, the Bhubaneswar campus seems more like a business school campus than an engineering college campus. The campus could be a little bigger, but the interior, classrooms, and labs are well-equipped, with a little corporate touch. Overall, the experience is good, but it should be a little bigger. Since it's a university now, it doesn't have a good front gate, and there is no proper cricket ground. These are aspects where the university can grow, but you will not feel too bad about the campus as it's small and well-maintained.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are very good; mostly, they are supportive. If you are having a doubt, then you can directly go to the faculty member’s chamber and clear your doubts. Most of the faculty members are good. The course curriculum includes all the domain-specific aspects and different core subjects and even includes many soft skill subjects. Labs provide exposure to other important domains like trading or yoga, which can add value to your personal and financial life. To become industry-ready, you have to work on your own by exploring different domains or doing some projects. Silicon also helps, as they charge 5000 after each academic year and provide you a diverse range of domains you can opt for as summer internships. Semester examinations are of a moderate level, but the mark evaluation is very fair and strict.",
              "Other": "It’s well-known and has a good reputation in the CSE background. So, if you have a keen interest in CSE, you can definitely choose this college. But overall, your career growth and academic growth depend on you. If you work hard here, you can grab a good opportunity; otherwise, if you're not skilled, no good or bad university can help, and Silicon is a little strict towards its academics."

Many courses are overly theoretical here, so I wish those would be replaced by practical courses. In Coimbatore, SNS is famous for conducting events and festivals. Students here conduct various technical and non-technical events, and students from other colleges can also participate. Since SNS College of Engineering, SNS College of Technology, and SNS College of Pharmacy are on the same campus, it seems crowded. But they manage the crowd by allotting different break times. Extracurricular activities like NSS and NCC are available."

Most preferably, I would say the library, which was useful for all final-year and project-delivering students. Almost all areas of the college and hostels had Wi-Fi. There were separate labs for ECE, EEE, CSE, IT, and Mech. Facilities in the college hostel were good, and the food quality was also good. There was a separate roof for medical facilities called the medical center. There were enough sports and games facilities for both day scholars and hostellers to play. More tournaments were held for sports and games.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers were very helpful, and the quality of the teaching was also good. If they didn't know, they referred to library books or other staff members and cleared our doubts. The course was relevant to the curriculum, and the course would be useful to students during their placements. Semester exams were not difficult. They were easier compared to other departments, and the pass percentage was 60/100 marks.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I was very interested in electronic devices, so I was eager to learn more about them. That’s why I choose ECE. The best thing about the course was that they taught with real-time and live examples. I would say there was nothing to improve in my course. Events and fests were held monthly once, and hackathons were also conducted. Scholarships were available for students who scored top marks in higher secondary, and a first-graduate scholarship was also available."

There is no AC availability here. If you need AC you have to pay 75,000 extra per year for it which is completely absurd. Hostel mess food is also not that great. There has been insects everywhere in the food time and again and we have complained about it multiple times, but no action has been taken. So in my opinion, paying 200000 for this hostel is not at all worth it. Better get an apartments outside the college.",

But in campus placement, you just need to master one teach because all companies hire for one teach. That's why the curriculum is not very good. There teaching methods are also not good. They just come and read the PPT in front of you and leave."

The highest package stands at 26 LPA, and the lowest package is 2 LPA. The average package offered will stand at 4 LPA in 2023. Internships are offered to outstanding students only and average students are supposed to find them themselves. Cognizant is the leading recruiter.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure in SVCE is one of the best in the state. Almost all labs are well-equipped but some can be quite old and lack new equipment. If you compare them with other colleges, then SVCE labs are quite good. The hostel might be the worst part, as the food, the quality of the rooms, and the and the hygiene are below average. Since non-vegetarian foods aren't allowed, the fee they charge for hostels is too high for vegetarian food with poor quality and taste, along with old rooms and beds. There is a medical center where first aid and resting beds are available, which is a good thing and an ambulance will be available for transportation to the local hospital. Sports are well encouraged in SVCE, especially cricket. The ground is well maintained and we have a state-level team that has won several trophies.",

There are enough facilities at the college. The curriculum is updated and good compared to the Anna University curriculum but it needs a lot of improvement to meet international standards. It makes industry ready only to an extent but we have to learn so many things ourselves, as there are a lot of things they don't teach. The semester exams will have a weight of 60% and the remaining 40% will be calculated from internal exams, which include 3 informative assessment tests and assignments. The pass percentage averages around 65%.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because of the wide opportunities in the software and hardware fields. It allows you to learn programming as well as electronics. The method of testing students should be changed as cheating prevails. Lots and lots of events are conducted, as that is what SVCE is known for. The campus is not so crowded as it spans over 100 acres, but we have to have a little to reach the bus bay to the classrooms, canteen and department. Lots of scholarships are offered to deserving students and extracurricular activities like clubs are available, which enhance social skills."

As a public university, we can't expect a number of events, but we will have fun. The number of students is very limited, like 60-72 students per department and a total of 6 departments.

Classrooms are also neatly maintained. Classrooms are spacious, and we are also given a projector. The department lacks a good internet Connection.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are helpful and approachable, but the teaching style is mostly theoretical and lacks hands-on industrial exposure. Some teachers are experienced and knowledgeable, while others rely too much on PowerPoint slides. The curriculum covers core concepts of artificial intelligence and data science, but a few subjects feel outdated and need revision to match current industry demands. Exams are moderate in difficulty, and the questions are mostly from the syllabus. The pass percentage is usually high, around 85- 90%, but scoring distinction requires consistent preparation. Overall, the curriculum could be more practical and job-oriented."

Many of the graduates are placed in web development. From 2020 to 2022, the placement percentage was 90%! But now, there has been a minor fall.

Only five out of 60 students got core placements, but if you study well, you can secure a core position. Don't worry, you can at least get into IT. You can choose this college for a better future.",
              "Infrastructure": "I'm currently in the 1st year. The hostel is good, and the overall infrastructure is very nice. However, many people say our college is one of the strictest in Chennai. They are strict about dress code, lab activities, and speaking in English. The food here is like heaven.",
              "Faculty": "They conduct about three model exams before the first semester and give internal marks based on these exams, along with small activities like PPT presentations and lab work. The teachers are experienced and skilled. The pass percentage of the college is high, but the college is a bit strict.",
              "Other": "In our college, the food is very nice, and it's considered the number one college in Chennai for having good hostel food. They also provide meals for day scholars."

There are many clubs where students can volunteer or participate in events and workshops they conduct.

The quality and taste of the food is very average, and there have also been reports of sometimes finding dead insects in the cooking utensils.",

              "Placements": "My batch was fine, i.e., Y23. The placements were average. The thing is, the college provides 100 percent placement on the website, but only some of the students are applicable to sit on placements. It does not include those who are not applicable, whose CGPA is less. And don't expect ECE core companies; there are too few.",
              "Infrastructure": "When it comes to the hostels, the college is pretty good. Hostel BH4 is newly built and even has AC facilities and is in new condition. Facility-wise, the college is decent. Wi-Fi is available in every hostel; one girls' hostel is there, and there are five boys' hostels, including one more newly built hostel, which is small, BH5.",
              "Faculty": "The curriculum is pretty hard if you are in the ECE branch. If you are taking this college, you will have to study. Some professors are strict, while some are lenient. There is pretty strict marking too. But professors are helpful; the curriculum sometimes is irrelevant. Many students do not fail."

We do have on-campus placements, and we have a dedicated training and placement cell, but overall, the average package has dropped, as it was around 14 LPA in 2022, but now it is just 10 LPA.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure at college is good, we have all sorts of labs, and we have enough hostels for students, but most of the hostels are not well maintained. Other issues are water disruption on a weekly basis, and only a few hostels have Wi-Fi facilities. We have air ducts in most of the hostels and AC in some.",
              "Faculty": "All faculty members are well qualified, and most of them are encouraging of hackathons and competitions. Curriculum is a bit hectic, but it is updated and aligned according to industry. The exams are difficult, and it is hard to score and get good grades when compared to other colleges."

              "Placements": "Around 80-85% of students get placed in this course. The highest package is 40 LPA for ECE and 1.3 crores for CSE. The average package is 13 LPA with a median of 12 LPA. Top recruiting companies are Samsung, BNY, Adobe, and MakeMyTrip. I do my first internship as a first-year student in a data analytics role in a company in offline mode. In my course, most students get placed, some in core and some in tech-related jobs. ECE is diverse and divided into various domains like robotics, AI/ML, automation, etc.",
              "Infrastructure": "The department infrastructure is good, and a new building solely for AI is under development. Wi-Fi and LAN facilities are available. Labs are well-equipped and have industry-based software and hardware. The library has three halls and a separate hall with PCs. It also has a noise-cancellation media room for shoots. Hostel facilities are average. Boys’ Hostel 4 has ACs and other facilities, but other hostels lack proper renovation and amenities. The quality of food is good compared to other colleges. The canteen area is small with limited options. Medical facilities are free for all and available 24/7.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are available after class hours in their cabins to solve student queries. Students can also reach out to faculty through email. All teachers are well-qualified with PhDs and Masters from IITs and other renowned colleges, with high levels of experience. The course curriculum is a bit basic at the start, but by semester 3, it focuses on company requirements and practical knowledge. The curriculum is very challenging, and grading is strict. Passing is absolute, but grading is relative.",
              "Other": "Choosing ECE was not by choice, but as I pursue the course, I realize that 90 percent of students opt for tech-related jobs, leaving less competition in core. The starting package in core is lower compared to tech, but job stability is higher. If one is interested in electronics, they should definitely consider this option. LNMIIT is known for its coding culture. We are exposed to advanced coding from the start, making it easier to secure more job offers. Fests are great and fun."

Google came to our college to recruit students. The main internship is off-campus, so we don't know much. Top roles offered are software developer, blockchain architect, and many more. As I don't know much, but some people got a post in finance also.",
              "Infrastructure": "Well, the academic area, library, and labs are clean and maintained with the best equipment and supplies. The hostels are good with internet, but we have to clean our rooms ourselves. Mess food is good, but this hostel is in a forest, so there are many animals and insects to be aware of.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are hard to understand but highly proficient and qualified with degrees from their own and foreign universities. The curriculum is relevant as it changes every 3 years again, and it is difficult for many people to fail in many subjects. Well, you need to study to get a good grade; otherwise, stay here in the summer.",

Still, there is the whole year left, so I think it's a very good number. In this college, getting an on-campus placement is easy because competition is less since the number of students in a batch is only 600–650, and around 500 sit for the placement.",
              "Infrastructure": "It's quite good, like you have all the basic requirements, but wardens are quite strict, which is a downgrade. Otherwise, everything is good, and the food is also good compared to other colleges. Wi-Fi is good, the speed is very good, but we have to log in again and again every 3 hours.",
              "Faculty": "Academics are very tough here; maintaining a good CG here is very hard. Above 7 CG here is considered very good. Professors are very strict at checking the papers, if the answer is fully correct then only they'll give marks, else zero, so this is a major downgrade. But the faculty is good, they teach well, and they provide the notes PDF in the classroom app, which is very helpful in case engineering students go to attend classes. 75 percent attendance is must here, so only to maintain the attendance we have to go.",
              "Other": "The best crowd I could have got, no ragging, only interaction that's on your will, very supportive seniors, good student unity. If the crowd is less, you can have a good college life here."

              "Infrastructure": "Central library is top-notch in terms of the study environment it provides, and the vast availability of all course related books. Only con is that it shuts down at 10:00 PM. In boys hostel, 4 rooms are spacious and common areas are also clean most of the time. Wi-Fi speed is good but you need to login after 3 hours every time so it gets a little annoying.",
              "Faculty": "Curriculum is almost exactly copied from IIT Kanpur. Teachers are quite qualified but their teaching is average at best. Grading in this college is very strict. Maintaining a good CGPA is quite a task in this college, giving you less time for non-academic stuff."

The hostel facility is old like the most famous hostel and the best hostel on campus is BH4 with a TT table and a badminton net with a night canteen and a mess inside. They started a laundry system in 2025 otherwise the other hostels are just not worth the hype, other hostels are like a jail with no AC.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty is great in terms of knowledge. Teaching they are up to other college levels where teachers just say their things and the student tries to understand all by their hard work. There is a midterm endterm and quiz system in college. There are no internals and assignment marks. The lab contains marks for assignments. I do not think it is at that level that the industry requires like in the first year we basically study PCM with C language and then the real course starts from the 2nd year. Passing percentages are good but CG maintenance is hard.",
              "Other": "I chose this college as it is great for Computer Science and Engineering. I am dissatisfied It is not upto what I was thinking initially They should not be strict about marking and should give students freedom to have a balance of personal and academics life Maintain a good CG is really tough in this college There are 3 fests in this college and the campus is around 100 acres for your understanding around 1 km long campus there is a lot of exposure as soo many clubs and events are going everyday."

Some good faculty members in my branch are Dr Admit Neogi, Dr Ashish Kumar Dwiwedi, MS Rajbir, and MS Preety Singh.",
              "Other": "The reason for choosing the semi-private college over some old, reputed government college was due to its coding environment and placement statistics. There are 3 fests that are conducted from Jan to mid-Feb every year, of which Vivacity (Cultural Fest ) is the best. We've hosted artists like Raftaar, Sees Kaur, and Admit Trivedi. Darshan Rawal, Seedhe Maut and many more over the past years."

Recruiters included TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Teach Mahindra, Capgemini and a few startups. Nearly 40% of students got internships from companies like BSNL, TCS iON and local IT firms. The common roles offered were Software Trainee, Embedded Intern, QA Analyst and Network Support Engineer.",
              "Infrastructure": "My department had decent Wi-Fi, well-maintained labs, and classrooms with projectors. The library was helpful for reference books and quiet study. The hostel facilities were average but manageable, with regular cleaning and basic amenities. Mess food was simple and sometimes repetitive, but the canteen offered better options. We had a small medical room for basic issues, and the campus had grounds for cricket, volleyball, and indoor games.",
              "Faculty": "Most of our faculty members were helpful and had good subject knowledge, especially in core electronics subjects. The teaching quality depended on the teacher, but overall it was satisfactory. The curriculum was updated with practical labs and project work, so it gave a decent foundation, though students had to put extra effort to become fully industry-ready. Semester exams are moderate. Neither too tough nor too easy. Anyone who studied regularly could clear them. The pass percentage in our course was generally above 85-90%.",
              "Other": "For me, the course was value for money because the fees were reasonable compared to the facilities and exposure we received. I chose B.Teach ECE (2021-25) because I wanted to learn both hardware and software. The best part was the practical labs and project opportunities, though I wish the department offered more industry-oriented workshops. Campus life was fairly active with cultural events, teach fests, and a friendly crowd. The campus surroundings were calm, and connectivity to the city was good. Scholarships were available, and there were enough extracurricular activities to stay involved."

              "Faculty": "Not all teachers are highly qualified. Some of the faculty are well-qualified. They teach us every subject with complete practical knowledge which makes a person industry-ready. Some irrelevant subjects can be excluded. Our is an old curriculum. There were no new technologies when we were studying. Now, for freshers, they have been introduced to new technology as their subjects.",
