In our 5th semester, recently a US healthcare company, Vivnovation, visited offering ₹15,000 per month as an intern role and a PPO of 22 LPA on satisfactory work performance. This year, the 2025 pass-out percentage of students placed stood at 76.5%, with 268 getting placed out of 350. The highest in-campus package offer is by Amazon, PwC, and Microsoft, which are 14 LPA, 12 LPA, and 8 LPA respectively. The roles are SAP Consultant and TS.",
              "Infrastructure": "The classrooms are well-equipped with proper seating arrangements and basic facilities. Every classroom is a smart class (no A/C). The labs are all Wi-Fi enabled with modern computers and architecture (A/C enabled). The library is big, well maintained, and has a large collection of books and reading space. Extra books can be provided on demand. Basic hostel facilities include bed, mattress, pillow, and bathroom items. Every room has average Wi-Fi with 16 Mbps speed. Mess food quality is low and not very nutritious. Medical, sports, gym, and games are well maintained and worth it.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers mostly are well qualified and knowledgeable, with good teaching methods, leaving some with a very rigid and boring way of teaching, which, we all can agree, happens in every college. The curriculum needs to be revised with modern subjects, and a big change is required in the first-year syllabus. Semester exams are application-based with good conceptual questions and average evaluation guidelines. There are two midterms of 50 marks summed up into 30, two quizzes of 5 marks each, 5 marks for attendance, 5 for assignment, and a 50-mark end-semester examination.",
              "Other": "Well, I got a 40% scholarship on fests due to my JEE rank, and this is a good option to go with for a CSE degree. The professors are okay, and the curriculum is good enough. You get a lot of time to work on your personal skills. Coding culture is too low, that can be worked upon, and clubs mostly begin normally but get lost in interior politics down the line. Fests are okay but can be made far better if the administration actually opens up and looks at things other than just academics. Crowd has increased definitely."

Wi-Fi quality is a bit disappointing on campus, almost everyone uses 5G in college because Jio 5G has very high internet speed on campus.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty are well-experienced, we can say more than 10-12 years of experience in teaching. Co-curricular activities took place frequently, where we could showcase multiple talents and take part in various tech-related events. Exams are strict and fair, and there is no chance of cheating or any malpractice.",
              "Other": "I chose this course to take a good course under low fees compared to B.Tech, whose fees are high, and I have an interest in both computer and electronics. By taking this course, I can engage with both of these, which may not have been possible if I had just taken B.Tech in computer science and this. The annual fest is of a flagship level where multiple events take place, and amazing artists come and perform for us. Overall, college is good with decent placement records."

Only interns who had done their summer internship were given ppo. Even the internship process itself was shady. I had a CGPA of 9.7 when Microsoft came and the college only allowed the top 30 students to submit their resumes. I was able to submit my resume but after that, I do not know what happened and only five students were randomly selected. Even their resumes were not that good. Same with the biggest company, Commvault, from whom mysteriously the names of several students were struck off. The college passed it off as company shortlisting but everybody knows what it is. No doubt no one was hired by Commvault and it subsequently banned SMIT, as far as I got to know. The TNP is very shady, bringing totally worthless companies offering a mere package of even 2.75 LPA with ~ 2 years of bond. The placement states are poor; they look, this is a tier-3 college. No doubt bringing companies is something I understand but why hide things? I can go on writing so much more about this but the result will be the same. I hope somebody needs to read this. If placement is the sole criteria, please do not come here. Manipal Jaipur, Chandigarh University, Amity Noida, and LPU are some good options for those who have messed up Main.

Some of them are good; others are really bad. They might be knowledgeable, as I had mentioned but there is a difference between being knowledgeable and being a good teacher. 3 stars just for the hostel and physical infrastructure.",

They might be very knowledgeable, having published so many research papers but they do not know how to impart that knowledge. One thing I would like to mention is that teachers are approachable. They will try their best to make you understand. Many of them are friendly as well and will try their best to help you, even on a personal level. But everything gets turned down because of the placement, poor management, and some egoistic teachers sitting at the top as heads of respective departments. The Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics department teachers are by far the best and most knowledgeable of the lot. The syllabus is outdated, in my frank opinion but I think that is the case with every tier-3 college. You need to explore things on your own, outside of college studies, to grow.",
              "Other": "Whatever I will be mentioning here will be absolutely true. As I mentioned, I am writing this anonymously so that the college does not figure me out. Not that I care if they figure it out but I still would like to keep my identity hidden. If you enjoy changing around and do not care anything about your career, then SMIT is just that. Fests and events are less than what they used to be in pre-covid times but the crowd here is fun-loving. Drinks, parties, strong friendships, fights, and romance—expect every bit of this. College is pretty hilly in these aspects. But if you are looking for placement, it is not good. I do not want to use harsh words but I will say this much: the college management has itself messed up everything. Companies cracked by students off-campus are shown as on-campus placements. Amazon has never come to this college. So is WatchGuard and that 36.5 LPA package you see. The only big branded companies that have ever come are Microsoft, Commvault, and Providence. College is little lenient if you have problem with If you are not getting any good colleges, I will recommend a few, and please trust me with this again. I have been at your place and know exactly what I should have done. Go to Manipal Jaipur, Chandigarh University, Amity Nodia, LPU, TIET, and MAIT. Trust me, these are way better than this college. One more thing to those people from my college who are outraged by this writing: I have written only the truth. Things that I could not say back in college due to fear of you people withholding my degree. I was one of the best in college but I am really ashamed of this college."

Study hour is maintained inside the campus, for which, from 6 to 9, no student is allowed to roam outside.",

It would be better if Wi-Fi were given to hostels because students have to move to either the library or the lawn to access it. Connectivity between students is good, and the seniors are helpful."

Some of the notable recruiters from the past three years are Accenture, Adani Group, Aptus Data Labs, Capgemini, Cognizant, Cozentus, CoreEL Technologies, Deloitte, DeepSource, Genpact, IBM, Infosys, Innoware, Jindal Group, LTTS, MentorGraphics, Micron Technology, Mindtree, Mindfire Solutions, Pcon Utilities, Prodapt, PwC, SAP Labs, Scaledge, Surya Digital, Spikewell, TCS, Tata Power, ValueLabs, Vodafone Idea, and Work.",
              "Infrastructure": "The lab is average because all the equipment is a little old. Around 80% of the equipment is working. Classrooms are good. Around 60% of classrooms have air conditioners. About 40 classrooms do not have air conditioners. The campus is very small. Classrooms have projectors. Wi-Fi is not available everywhere, but it is available in limited areas.The library is available. Some labs and classrooms are average. The hostel is average because there is no Wi-Fi. They maintain it very well. The security system is very good. They are very helpful to us. The food quality is good. The canteen is also good. There is a doctor available in the evening. If students want medicine, they have to go out of the campus. Sports are very good. Students get leather courts. There are 2 basketball courts, two badminton courts, one volleyball court, and two indoor courts. There are badminton courts inside the hostel.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are knowledgeable. The teaching should cover both theory and practicals. It should be interesting. Different teaching methodologies like lectures, case studies, project work, etc., should be provided. Assessments at regular intervals are held to understand the progress. The curriculum should be in sync with the current industry requirements and the latest technological advancements. Outdated courses would not help students perform well in today's job scenarios. Students must acquire relevant skills that companies look for along with their academics. It may involve internships, live projects, industry-based learning, and exposure to existing tools and technologies. Faculty members are good. They help in any situation. They are always ready to help students on or off campus. We have B.Tech and master's courses. Exams are quite challenging, and the evaluation process is tough. Therefore, if anyone is willing to come, please read this carefully regarding the last year, 2023.",
              "Other": "I am an average student. I had no choice, so I joined this college. Our course is good. Our college should provide more facilities like Wi-Fi in the hostel, etc. College life is below average. Fests are not very grateful."

              "Infrastructure": "Our college has both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned classrooms with projectors, good ventilation, and lighting. Wi-Fi is available in labs, library, and IICELL (office). The library offers a good pattern of seating arrangement. It has ample books and newspapers. Hostels can accommodate 4 students in each room, with decent facilities. The food is manageable despite occasional issues and separate canteens are available for vegetarian, non-vegetarian, guests, and senior students.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers possess in-depth subject knowledge and provide consultation during college hours for doubts. The curriculum is a bit industry-relevant, with opportunities to learn essential skills. Semester exams are tough, requiring 40 out of 100 marks to pass, with no minimum for midterms or teacher assessments."

              "Placements": "Placements are good. Many MNC companies are coming to the campus for the recruitment process, including Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Deloitte, and all. Nearly 70 percent of students will surely be placed, but that number varies. In 2021, a good percentage of students were placed, but now, as of the volatile market scenario, the placements are a little affected in 2024-2025.",
              "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure is not up to the mark. As it's a university, the Bhubaneswar campus seems more like a business school campus than an engineering college campus. The campus could be a little bigger, but the interior, classrooms, and labs are well-equipped, with a little corporate touch. Overall, the experience is good, but it should be a little bigger. Since it's a university now, it doesn't have a good front gate, and there is no proper cricket ground. These are aspects where the university can grow, but you will not feel too bad about the campus as it's small and well-maintained.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty members are very good; mostly, they are supportive. If you are having a doubt, then you can directly go to the faculty member’s chamber and clear your doubts. Most of the faculty members are good. The course curriculum includes all the domain-specific aspects and different core subjects and even includes many soft skill subjects. Labs provide exposure to other important domains like trading or yoga, which can add value to your personal and financial life. To become industry-ready, you have to work on your own by exploring different domains or doing some projects. Silicon also helps, as they charge 5000 after each academic year and provide you a diverse range of domains you can opt for as summer internships. Semester examinations are of a moderate level, but the mark evaluation is very fair and strict.",
              "Other": "It’s well-known and has a good reputation in the CSE background. So, if you have a keen interest in CSE, you can definitely choose this college. But overall, your career growth and academic growth depend on you. If you work hard here, you can grab a good opportunity; otherwise, if you're not skilled, no good or bad university can help, and Silicon is a little strict towards its academics."

              "Placements": "Our college provides decent placements for all students. The placement percentage is above 40% every year. They bring recruiters from both IT fields and also core fields. They also bring top most recruiters from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Deloitte, etc. The average salary package they provide is around 5 LPA. The highest was 22 LPA last year for the department of electrical and electronic engineering.",
              "Infrastructure": "Our college has a wide and large campus with technology, engineering, nursing, allied science, and pharmacy, and also two separate hostels for boys and girls inside the campus. We have lawn spaces to sit, study, and enjoy during break hours. There are 2 libraries, 2 cafeterias, and one large food court. We have a large sports ground for students. Hostel has lots of cupboards and tables for each student separately. Foodcourt provides good food of good quality at a cheaper price. Food in hostel is average.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are very helpful and encourage us to build our startups and everything. While some are partial towards some particular students which I see as the major disadvantage of faculty members. All faculty members are highly eligible with their degree. Most of them are genuine toward students education and knowledge. Course curriculum is relevant and the practical studies help students to apply them in real life. We have internal exams every 2 months. As we write 3 internal exams the end semester becomes easy.",
              "Other": "I chose electronics and communication as I'm very much interested in satellites and research. The best thing about the course is you can apply for any field both hardware and software. More practical studies may help students to improve the course. Our college conducts lots of events both technical and non-technical. They celebrate festivals like Pongal, Christmas, and even Valentine's day is celebrated. Sports day is given equal importance. The favorite spot of most students is the food court where they connect and interact with students of other departments."

The highest package is around 13.5 LPA, the lowest package offered is 2.5 LPA, and the average package is 4.5 LPA. Top recruiting companies are CTS, Accenture, Wipro, TCS, and Zoho. Only very few students got internships at ISRO and from some start-up companies. Top roles offered are Software Developer, Mobile App Developer, Full Stack Developer, and DevOps Engineer.",
              "Infrastructure": "The whole campus supports Wi-Fi connectivity, but with very low internet speed. Here, we don't have hi-fi systems in our lab; mostly all the labs are equipped with AC. Every classroom is equipped with a projector and smart board and has proper ventilation. The hostel is situated inside the campus. Talking about the quality of food available in the mess, it is very average. There is a food court available inside the campus which provides good quality food. SNS College of Technology gives more importance to sports and encourages us to participate in various sports events like cricket, basketball, volleyball, etc.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers here are qualified, helpful, and knowledgeable. Mostly every staff member uses smart boards for teaching so that we can easily take notes, and it is way easier to understand than with regular boards. This course is curriculum-relevant, and also it makes the students industry-ready. The semester exams are moderately difficult, and the pass percentage is 50%.",
              "Other": "I am fascinated by how technology works, and I would like to solve real-world problems creatively using programming. Many courses are overly theoretical here, so I wish those would be replaced by practical courses. In Coimbatore, SNS is famous for conducting events and festivals. Students here conduct various technical and non-technical events, and students from other colleges can also participate. Since SNS College of Engineering, SNS College of Technology, and SNS College of Pharmacy are on the same campus, it seems crowded. But they manage the crowd by allotting different break times. Extracurricular activities like NSS and NCC are available."

There were separate labs for ECE, EEE, CSE, IT, and Mech. Facilities in the college hostel were good, and the food quality was also good. There was a separate roof for medical facilities called the medical center. There were enough sports and games facilities for both day scholars and hostellers to play. More tournaments were held for sports and games.",

The course was relevant to the curriculum, and the course would be useful to students during their placements. Semester exams were not difficult. They were easier compared to other departments, and the pass percentage was 60/100 marks.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I was very interested in electronic devices, so I was eager to learn more about them. That’s why I choose ECE. The best thing about the course was that they taught with real-time and live examples. I would say there was nothing to improve in my course. Events and fests were held monthly once, and hackathons were also conducted. Scholarships were available for students who scored top marks in higher secondary, and a first-graduate scholarship was also available."

We have libraries, but they don't have a period for reading. If you are interested, you can go to the admin office, get a library pass, and use the library. Other than that, the canteen service is not as good as you might think; it feels like a scam, so choose wisely.",
              "Faculty": "Some of the teachers are really talented, while some are just not helpful and tell us to study on our own. However, many teachers in our class teach us excellently, and if you have doubts during lectures, they clear them instantly.",

However, it didn't go as well as I expected due to college timings and other concerns. The college has zero extracurricular activities, so if you want to excel in sports, please choose other colleges."

The hostel fee is 60,000 plus a 5,000 deposit. Mess food is there but frankly, mess food is not good and not hygienic. There is no big canteen on campus, so we can not eat when we are hungry.",

In a library, you can't access all the books in it and its tough to take books in a library.

Hostel food was pretty bad so it was better to eat outside.",

You don't have to worry about the curriculum because they update the syllabus from year to year for industrial needs. The semester exams are pretty difficult and easy on your own. The pass percentage is an average 80%.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because for the industrial boom because most of the companies are it so I chose it. They want to lower their feel structure because it is too high for the students. The main point is that they won't allow mobile devices the campus and the connectivity is so poor that events and festivals happen occasionally. About the extracurricular activities they have (NSS and NCC) and sports like tennis, volleyball, kabbadi, khokho, etc."

The highest package stands at 26 LPA, and the lowest package is 2 LPA. The average package offered will stand at 4 LPA in 2023. Internships are offered to outstanding students only and average students are supposed to find them themselves. Cognizant is the leading recruiter.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure in SVCE is one of the best in the state. Almost all labs are well-equipped but some can be quite old and lack new equipment. If you compare them with other colleges, then SVCE labs are quite good. The hostel might be the worst part, as the food, the quality of the rooms, and the and the hygiene are below average. Since non-vegetarian foods aren't allowed, the fee they charge for hostels is too high for vegetarian food with poor quality and taste, along with old rooms and beds. There is a medical center where first aid and resting beds are available, which is a good thing and an ambulance will be available for transportation to the local hospital. Sports are well encouraged in SVCE, especially cricket. The ground is well maintained and we have a state-level team that has won several trophies.",

There are enough facilities at the college. The curriculum is updated and good compared to the Anna University curriculum but it needs a lot of improvement to meet international standards. It makes industry ready only to an extent but we have to learn so many things ourselves, as there are a lot of things they don't teach. The semester exams will have a weight of 60% and the remaining 40% will be calculated from internal exams, which include 3 informative assessment tests and assignments. The pass percentage averages around 65%.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because of the wide opportunities in the software and hardware fields. It allows you to learn programming as well as electronics. The method of testing students should be changed as cheating prevails. Lots and lots of events are conducted, as that is what SVCE is known for. The campus is not so crowded as it spans over 100 acres, but we have to have a little to reach the bus bay to the classrooms, canteen and department. Lots of scholarships are offered to deserving students and extracurricular activities like clubs are available, which enhance social skills."

Sports are also conducted every year.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty-to-student ratio is about 1:20, and their approach is also good. Faculty members play a key role here in developing the university to great heights and the semester exams are of moderate difficulty level. The course curriculum is designed perfectly for real-world applications. The pass percentage is approximately 85-90%.",
              "Other": "I have chosen this college because it is a government university and one of the best universities in our country. The college provides a great study environment, which makes us feel comfortable. There is no pressure from the faculty members. A tech fest is conducted once every 2 years, and other fests are conducted at frequent intervals."

              "Other": "I want to focus on my career in government-based jobs; I want to work in DRDO, ISRO, etc. The best thing about our course is that if you are interested, you will understand quickly, and if you do work on chips and other instruments, your interest will gradually increase. In our course, we want to do more lab work and gain practical experience; this is something that should be improved in all colleges. The events conducted by our department are: 1. Inaugural—this is for inviting freshers to our college and to our department, and this event is done by every department individually; 2. Department Activities (DA)—in this, seniors and juniors form a team and play games like volleyball, cricket, badminton, etc., and winners also get prizes in this event, and this event is done by every department individually; 3. Rhapsody—this event is conducted by all branches, and this event includes games, events, and other extracurricular activities, and every activity has some points. At last, whichever department gets the highest number of points wins the Rhapsody Cup, and M.Tech students are also included in this event; 4. Sigmoid—this is the national-level technical symposium of the Electronics and Communication Engineering branch, and I am proud to say that I am a student currently pursuing a B.Tech in the Electronics and Communication Engineering branch."

              "Faculty": "Faculty members are helpful and approachable, but the teaching style is mostly theoretical and lacks hands-on industrial exposure. Some teachers are experienced and knowledgeable, while others rely too much on PowerPoint slides. The curriculum covers core concepts of artificial intelligence and data science, but a few subjects feel outdated and need revision to match current industry demands. Exams are moderate in difficulty, and the questions are mostly from the syllabus. The pass percentage is usually high, around 85- 90%, but scoring distinction requires consistent preparation. Overall, the curriculum could be more practical and job-oriented."
